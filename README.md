## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Robert Loghin. I am currently a medical engineering student at UMPhST "George Emil Palade" in Targu Mures.
I mostly work in C++/C# but I am trying to learn other languages too, like Python and Lua.

Here I will upload my various programming assignments from college, and also any passion projects that I work on.
